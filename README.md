# timescaledb

A highly efficient, enterprise-grade TimescaleDB time-series database CRUD wrapper and state-routing backend client for the collaborative CoCreate ecosystem. This wrapper maps TimescaleDB's fast ingestion, automatic partitioning, and native PostgreSQL time-series optimizations into CoCreate's unified JSON interface.

## The Power of the CoCreate Unified Ecosystem

This is not just another database driver. By wrapping TimescaleDB into the CoCreate state-routing pipeline, you unlock the full power of a multi-cloud, multi-model data orchestration mesh:

* **Unified JSON Interface (MongoDB-like Syntax):** You don't need to write manual PostgreSQL hypertable queries or configure complex time-bucket SQL functions. CoCreate translates standard NoSQL JSON CRUD operations (such as `object.create` or `object.read`) transparently into optimized relational time-series statements under the hood.
* **Parallel Multi-Database Writing:** Write to many target databases simultaneously with a single API call. You can stream transactional data to MongoDB (for instant operational state), vectorize it into Qdrant (for real-time semantic search), and persist it in TimescaleDB (for high-velocity time-series partitioning and analytics) in perfect parallel harmony:

$$\text{Write Command} \xrightarrow{\text{Parallel Mesh}} \begin{cases} \text{MongoDB} & \text{(ACID Transaction Store)} \\ \text{Qdrant} & \text{(Semantic Vector Search)} \\ \text{TimescaleDB} & \text{(Optimized Time-Series Core)} \end{cases}$$

* **Dynamic State-Routing:** Isolate multi-tenant environments effortlessly. The routing mesh automatically injects tenant metadata and organization boundaries, ensuring isolated time-series metrics tracking within your shared TimescaleDB nodes.

## Why TimescaleDB?

TimescaleDB is an open-source relational database engine designed for time-series, IoT, and metrics analytics, built as an extension on top of PostgreSQL. It provides the elastic write scale and storage compression usually associated with specialized NoSQL systems, while maintaining full SQL support, robust index structures, and strict ACID transactional guarantees. Its unique "hypertables" automatically partition data across time and space behind the scenes.

By routing high-frequency streaming events, continuous server metrics, device logs, and system audits straight to TimescaleDB via this wrapper, you experience enterprise-grade relational analytics, massive time-series scale, and automated data retention management.

## Unified JSON Payload Examples

Here are the complete, real-world JSON objects representing raw payloads routed through the CoCreate system. By declaring an array in the `storage` key, CoCreate fires the write operations to all specified backends simultaneously in parallel.

### 1. Writing a Full Transaction Object (`object.create`)

When this operational payload is sent, CoCreate registers it, processes the nested JSON fields, and automatically warehouses it across all listed parallel storage platforms.

```json
{
  "method": "object.create",
  "storage": ["timescaledb", "mongodb", "qdrant"], // Array of storages to store in parallel!
  "database": "sales_analytics",
  "array": "order_events",
  "object": {
    "_id": "order_77c8f2a9_3b01",
    "customer": {
      "id": "cust_88301",
      "email": "customer@example.com",
      "region": "North America",
      "acquisition_channel": "Google Search"
    },
    "transaction": {
      "payment_method": "Credit Card",
      "currency": "USD",
      "subtotal": 249.99,
      "discount": 15.00,
      "tax": 18.80,
      "total": 253.79
    },
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": "prod_head_009",
        "name": "Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unit_price": 199.99
      },
      {
        "product_id": "prod_stand_012",
        "name": "Aluminum Headphone Stand",
        "category": "Accessories",
        "quantity": 2,
        "unit_price": 25.00
      }
    ],
    "shipping": {
      "carrier": "FedEx",
      "service": "2-Day Air",
      "estimated_delivery": "2026-07-20T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  },
  "organization_id": "org_enterprise_99x",
  "user_id": "usr_sales_runner_402",
  "timeStamp": "2026-07-18T18:40:43.000Z"
}

```

### 2. Reading and Filtering Warehoused Data (`object.read`)

Querying targets a single database engine via a string filter syntax. The query below retrieves high-value orders handled by a specific shipping carrier from TimescaleDB, sorting them by total sale volume.

```json
{
  "method": "object.read",
  "storage": "timescaledb",
  "database": "sales_analytics",
  "array": "order_events",
  "filter": {
    "query": {
      "transaction.total": { "$gte": 100.00 },
      "shipping.carrier": "FedEx"
    },
    "sort": [
      { "key": "transaction.total", "direction": "desc" }
    ],
    "limit": 50,
    "index": 0
  },
  "organization_id": "org_enterprise_99x"
}

```
